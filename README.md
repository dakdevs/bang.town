</div>

Bang.town is a custom search engine utility that implements and extends the concept of "bang shortcuts" (popularized by DuckDuckGo) with several unique features designed to enhance your browsing experience.

## Features

### üîç Bang Shortcuts
- Perform quick searches on different websites using bang commands (e.g., `!c hello` to chat with ChatGPT)
- Built-in default bangs for popular services:
  - `!s` - ChatGPT Search with GPT-4
  - `!4o` - ChatGPT with GPT-4
  - `!t3` - T3 Chat
  - `!w` - Wikipedia
  - `!yt` - YouTube
  - `!gh` - GitHub
  - `!so` - Stack Overflow
  - And many more!
- DuckDuckGo Fallback: If a bang isn't found in your custom or default bangs, automatically falls back to DuckDuckGo's extensive bang system

### üõ†Ô∏è Custom Bang Management
- Create your own custom bang shortcuts
- Each custom bang consists of a key and a URL pattern
- Smart validation prevents infinite loops
- Duplicate detection avoids conflicts with existing bangs
- Override built-in bangs with your own custom URLs

### üîÑ Sharing Functionality
- Share your custom bang configurations with others
- Generate shareable URLs that preserve all custom bang settings
- Share individual bangs with unique codes
- Import bangs from other users

### üîé Search and Organization
- Fuzzy search feature for finding specific bangs
- Organized interface showing both custom and default bangs
- Clear indication when custom bangs override defaults
- Set default search engine for non-bang queries

### üåê Browser Integration

- Can be set up as a custom search engine
